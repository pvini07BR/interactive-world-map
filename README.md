# interactive-world-map
 An 3D interactive world map made with Godot Engine 4.0, C# Language and Triangle library

This is an quite heavy project, it reads an 10 megabyte file, then generates 242 countries and generate their meshes with the Triangle library. Each country has their name and flag. All 242 .svg country flag files are in the project.

I plan to add more cool graphics in the map, and make then to turn on and off on the menu. And maybe refactor the entire project.
